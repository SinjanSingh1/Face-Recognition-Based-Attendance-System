Recognize The faces And Take Automatic Attandance.

This project is a web application demonstrating the use of facial recognition for marking attendance. It is a web application that can be used by the company to manage attendance of its employees.

## Functionality Supported

- Register employees by adding their photos.
- View attendance reports of all employees. Attendance can be filtered by date or employee.

## Built Using

 - [OpenCV]() - Open Source Computer Vision and Machine Learning software library
 - [Dlib]() - C++ Library containing Machine Learning Algorithms
 - [face_recognition]() - by Adam Geitgey
 - [Flask]() - Python framework for web development

## Scope of the project:

Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also convers web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.
